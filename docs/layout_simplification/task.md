# Layout Simplification & Refinement

- [x] **Analysis**
  - [x] Review user feedback on "clutter" and "broken screenshots".
  - [x] Identify layout bottlenecks in `ProductShowcase` and `Hero`.

- [x] **Structural Simplification (1 Message = 1 Section)**
  - [x] **App Structure (`page.tsx`)**: Increase vertical rhythm.
  - [x] **Product Showcase Split**:
    - [x] Isolate "Ato Product Intro" as a standalone focus.
    - [x] Isolate "Roadmap (Promise)" as a standalone focus.
  - [x] **Hero Refinement**: Ensure clarity and space.

- [x] **Visual Repair**
  - [x] Fix `PhoneMockup` positioning and overlapping issues in `ProductShowcase`.
  - [x] Ensure "Screenshot" display is clean and stable.

- [x] **Final Polish**
  - [x] **Cropping Phone Mockup**: Adjust `ProductShowcase` to show only top half of phone.
  - [x] **Screenshot Integration**: Restore split layout but use user's preferred screenshot inside `PhoneMockup`.
  - [x] **Copy Refinement**: Balance abstract/concrete tone in Hero stats.
  - [x] Verify "Scroll Experience" (rhythm and flow).

- [x] **Studio Branding Refinement**
  - [x] **Tone Check**: Remove overly dramatic copy ("Scorching sun...").
  - [x] **Scope Adjustment**: Emphasize "Atto Hub = Studio" (Multi-product future), not just "Ato".
  - [x] **Header Cleanup**: Remove top "Ato" button.
